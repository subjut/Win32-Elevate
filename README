Win32::Elevate version 0.01
==========================

Win32::Elevate provides a few simple facilities on Windows to elevate
your currently running perl process to higher credentials, namely SYSTEM
and TrustedInstaller. To achieve this feat, this package uses the
standard Win32 API mangled through some rudimentary XS code.
Obviously, this only works on Windows, starting with Vista, and will
fail to even compile on any other platform. Your Perl distribution
needs a C compiler and access to the standard windows header files.

Please note, that you must run you perl script with administrative
privileges. It's possible to circumvent Window's user account protection
or even gain admin privileges programmatically without user interaction,
but for security reasons, this package does not do so.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, either use CPAN.
For manual installation, type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Depending on your distribution, you will have to use the appropriate
make command (e.g. gmake on Strawberry Perl). To find out, simply run

   perl -V:make
