Win32::Elevate version 0.01
==========================

Win32::Elevate provides a few simple facilities on Windows to elevate
your currently running perl process or thread to higher credentials,
namely SYSTEM and TrustedInstaller. To achieve this feat, this package
uses the standard Win32 API mangled through some rudimentary XS code.
Obviously, this only works on Windows, starting with Vista, and will
fail to even compile on any other platform. Your Perl distribution
needs a C compiler and access to the standard windows header files.

Please note, that you must run your perl script with administrative
privileges. It's possible to circumvent Window's user account protection
or even gain admin elevation programmatically without user interaction,
but for security reasons, this package does not provide such a function.

This module was tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, either use CPAN or install manually.
For manual installation, type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Depending on your distribution, you will have to use the appropriate
make command. To find out what flavour of make your perl distribution
comes with, simply run

   perl -V:make


DEPENDENCIES

Obviously, this only runs on Windows.
