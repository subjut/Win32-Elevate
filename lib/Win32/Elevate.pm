=head1 NAME

Win32::Elevate - Perl module for gaining higher access priviledges

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Win32::Elevate;
  
  # Gaining NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM priviledges to access files and registry
  # entries locked away from normal users
  Win32::Elevate::BecomeSystem();
  
  # Some files and especially registry entries are not even acessible
  # by SYSTEM. We need TrustedInstaller priviledges for that.
  Win32::Elevate::BecomeTI();
  
  # Do some totally not shady stuffâ€¦
  
  # Done! Go back to user context.
  Win32::Elevate::RevertToSelf();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this module is to provide a couple of functions to
access files and registry entries to which not even an elevated
administrative user has access to. For this to work, the current
process already needs to have elevated permissions.


B<WARNING!> If you don't know, what you are doing, this can obviously
be fatally dangerous, such as an unbootable system. So do your research
and, especially, test your code thoroughly.

=head2 Functions

=over

=item B<Win32::Elevate::BecomeSystem()>

Elevates the B<current process> to gain NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM priviledges.

Returns a positive value on success. On faliure, it returns C<0> and the
current process is not altered.

=item B<Win32::Elevate::BecomeTI()>

Elevates the B<first thread> of the current process to gain
NT SERVICE/TrustedInstaller priviledges. Since this only works on the first
thread of a process, you cannot spawn another thread and expect it to have
TrustedInstaller priviledges.

Returns a positive value on success. On faliure, it returns C<0> and the current
process/thread is not altered.

=item B<Win32::Elevate::RevertToSelf()>

Undoes the priviledge changes made by C<Win32::Elevate::BecomeSystem()> and/or 
C<Win32::Elevate::BecomeTI()>. The current process reverts to the same 
priviledges as before any of these two functions were called.

Returns a positive value on success. On faliure, it returns C<0> and the current
process/thread is not altered.

=head2 Error Checking

You can check C<$^E> or use C<Win32::FormatMessage( Win32::GetLastError() )>
to get a descriptive error, but it might not be very informative. The C code
calls several Win32 APIs. Since C<$^E> is set to the latest API call, you 
won't know where it went bang!


=head1 CAVEATS

Obviously, this module only works on Windows. Also, it's not threadsafe.


=head1 UNDER THE HOOD

This module uses well known security design shortcomings in the Win32 API to gain priviledges usually reserved for system processes. In short, a process running as an elevated user who is a member of the I<Administrator> group can obtain C<SeDebugPrivilege>. This in turn allows that process to copy and modify access tokens of system processes and use such a token to impersonate its access rights.
